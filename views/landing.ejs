				I built this app as both a way to practice and demonstrate my full stack web development skills, 
				and to serve as a library where I could preserve the recipes my grandmothers used to make for me and my family. This web 
				app was built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the front end, and Node, Express, and MongoDB for the back end. Please 
				let me know how you enjoy the functionality of the website, and I hope you may come across a recipe or two that you might
				enjoy as well! Also, feel free to make an account and add your own family recipe if you would like to :-)
